# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the Python programming tasks from the 0x00 project. The project focuses on introducing Python programming basics, including printing, string manipulation, and coding style adherence.

## Project Description
The tasks cover a range of Python programming concepts, from basic "Hello, World" scripts to string manipulation and understanding Python's coding style guide (PEP8). Each task is designed to reinforce fundamental Python programming skills.

## Files and Directories

## How to Use
- Each Python script can be executed directly using the Python interpreter.
- Shell scripts can be executed in the terminal, and they interact with specific environment variables.
- C function is part of a larger C program, and its usage is demonstrated in the `10-main.c` file.

## Requirements
- Python scripts are expected to run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Shell scripts are designed for the Bash shell.
- C function should be compiled using `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Coding Style
- Python scripts should adhere to the PEP8 coding style.
- C code should follow the Betty style guide.
