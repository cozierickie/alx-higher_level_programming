Project 0x01 - Python: If/Else, Loops, Functions
Introduction
This project focuses on building fundamental skills in Python programming, covering topics such as control flow tools (if/else), loops (while, for), functions, and basic syntax. The tasks involve writing Python scripts to perform specific operations and solving problems, all while adhering to specific coding requirements and best practices.

Tasks
Task 0: Positive Anything is Better Than Negative Nothing
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. The source code needs completion to print whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

Task 1: The Last Digit
Similar to Task 0, this program assigns a random signed number to the variable number. Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number and provide additional information based on its value.

Task 2: I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia. And When I Can't Fall Asleep, I Play What I Call the Alphabet Game
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without a new line. Use only one print function with string format and one loop.

Task 3: When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup, I Never Thought That It Would Pay Off
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. Use only one print function with string format and one loop.

Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal. Use only one print function with string format and one loop.

Task 5: 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces. Use no more than 2 print functions with string format and one loop.

Task 6: Inventing is a Combination of Brains and Materials. The More Brains You Use, the Less Material You Need
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by commas and spaces, and the two digits must be different. Use no more than 3 print functions with string format and no more than 2 loops.

Task 7: islower
Write a function islower(c) that checks if a character is lowercase. Use the ord() function. Returns True if c is lowercase and False otherwise.

Task 8: To Uppercase
Write a function uppercase(str) that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. Use no more than 2 print functions with string format and one loop.

Task 9: There Are Only 3 Colors, 10 Digits, and 7 Notes; It's What We Do with Them That's Important
Write a function print_last_digit(number) that prints the last digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit.

Task 10: a + b
Write a function add(a, b) that adds two integers and returns the result.

Task 11: a ^ b
Write a function pow(a, b) that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

Task 12: Fizz Buzz
Write a function fizzbuzz() that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

Task 13: Insert in Sorted Linked List
Write a function insert_node(listint_t **head, int number) in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. Returns the address of the new node or NULL if it fails.

Conclusion
This project aims to enhance your understanding of Python programming fundamentals, including control flow, loops, functions, and coding practices. Make sure to follow the given requirements and constraints for each task. Happy coding!
