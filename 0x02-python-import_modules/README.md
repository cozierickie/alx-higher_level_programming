0x02. Python - import & modules
Description
This project explores the fundamentals of Python programming, focusing on the use of imports, modules, and command line arguments. Various tasks cover the following learning objectives:

Importing functions from other files
Creating modules
Using the built-in function dir()
Preventing code in a script from being executed when imported
Utilizing command line arguments in Python programs
Files
0-add.py

A program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
1-calculation.py

A program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, performs various mathematical operations, and prints the results.
2-args.py

A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
3-infinite_add.py
