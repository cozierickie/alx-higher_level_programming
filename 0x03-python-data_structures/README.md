0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Project Overview
This project focuses on Python programming with an emphasis on data structures like lists and tuples. The tasks include writing Python scripts and, in some cases, C programs with specific requirements. The key learning objectives include understanding the use of lists, differences and similarities between strings and lists, common list methods, using lists as stacks and queues, list comprehensions, understanding tuples, and more.

Project Structure
0-print_list_integer.py

Function: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Description: Prints all integers of a list, one per line.
1-element_at.py

Function: def element_at(my_list, idx):
Description: Retrieves an element from a list. Returns None for negative indices or out-of-range indices.
2-replace_in_list.py

Function: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
Description: Replaces an element in a list at a specific position. Returns the original list if the index is negative or out of range.
3-print_reversed_list_integer.py

Function: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Description: Prints all integers of a list in reverse order, one per line.
4-new_in_list.py

Function: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
Description: Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. Returns a copy of the original list if the index is negative or out of range.
5-no_c.py

Function: def no_c(my_string):
Description: Removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
6-print_matrix_integer.py

Function: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
Description: Prints a matrix of integers.
7-add_tuple.py

Function: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
Description: Adds two tuples and returns a tuple with the sum of corresponding elements.
8-multiple_returns.py

Function: def multiple_returns(sentence):
Description: Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. If the sentence is empty, the first character is None.
9-max_integer.py

Function: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
Description: Finds the biggest integer in a list. Returns None if the list is empty.
10-divisible_by_2.py

Function: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
Description: Finds all multiples of 2 in a list. Returns a new list with True or False for each element.
11-delete_at.py

Function: def delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0):
Description: Deletes the item at a specific position in a list. Returns the same list if the index is negative or out of range.
12-switch.py

Description: Switches the values of variables a and b.
13-is_palindrome.c

Function: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
Description: Checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
