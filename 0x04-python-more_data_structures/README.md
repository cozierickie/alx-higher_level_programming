0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks related to sets, dictionaries, and more. The project covers fundamental concepts, such as sets, dictionaries, lambda functions, and map, filter, and reduce functions.

Tasks Overview

** The project consists of several tasks, each addressing specific learning objectives. Here's a brief summary of the tasks:

0 - Squared Simple: Compute the square value of all integers in a matrix.

1 - Search and Replace: Replace all occurrences of an element with another in a new list.

2 - Unique Addition: Add all unique integers in a list only once.

3 - Present in Both: Return a set of common elements in two sets.

4 - Only Differents: Return a set of all elements present in only one set.

5 - Number of Keys: Return the number of keys in a dictionary.

6 - Print Sorted Dictionary: Print a dictionary by ordered keys.

7 - Update Dictionary: Replace or add key/value in a dictionary.

8 - Simple Delete by Key: Delete a key in a dictionary.

9 - Multiply by 2: Return a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

10 - Best Score: Return a key with the biggest integer value.

11 - Multiply by Using Map: Return a list with all values multiplied by a number using map.

12 - Roman to Integer: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.

13 - Weighted average!
#advanced
