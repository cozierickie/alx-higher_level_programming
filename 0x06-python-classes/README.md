Square Class
This project introduces the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on the implementation of a Square class. The class evolves through various tasks, each building upon the previous one. The primary learning objectives include understanding classes, instances, attributes (public, protected, private), methods, properties, and more.

Tasks Overview
0. My first square
Define an empty Square class.
1. Square with size
Add a private instance attribute size to the Square class.
Instantiate the class with an optional size.
2. Size validation
Enhance the Square class to validate the size during instantiation.
Raise exceptions for invalid size inputs.
3. Area of a square
Implement a public instance method area in the Square class.
Calculate and return the area of the square.
4. Access and update private attribute
Add property methods for getting and setting the private attribute size.
Implement a public instance method area to calculate the square's area.
5. Printing a square
Extend the Square class to include a my_print method.
Print the square using '#' characters based on its size.
6. Coordinates of a square
Introduce a private instance attribute position to the Square class.
Enhance the my_print method to consider the position when printing the square.
7. Singly linked list (Advanced)
Implement a Node class representing a node in a singly linked list.
Create a SinglyLinkedList class that can print the entire list and perform sorted insertion.
8. Print Square instance (Advanced)
Add a __str__ method to the Square class for a formatted string representation.
Achieve the same behavior as the my_print method.
9. Compare 2 squares (Advanced)
Enable comparison operators for the Square class based on square area.
10. ByteCode -> Python #5 (Advanced)
Implement a Python class MagicClass to replicate a given Python bytecode.
Understand the disassembled bytecode and recreate the class accordingly.
