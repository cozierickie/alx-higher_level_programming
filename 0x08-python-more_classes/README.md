N Queens Puzzle Solver
Overview
This project is a Python program that solves the N Queens puzzle, a classic chess problem where N non-attacking queens need to be placed on an N×N chessboard. The solutions are printed to the console, showcasing valid queen placements on the chessboard.

Features
Solves the N Queens puzzle for a given N value.
Prints all possible solutions, with one solution per line.
Provides a user-friendly command-line interface.
Usage
To run the program, use the following command:
./101-nqueens.py N

Replace N with an integer greater than or equal to 4. The program will print every valid solution for the N Queens puzzle.

Example:
./101-nqueens.py 4

Output:
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
