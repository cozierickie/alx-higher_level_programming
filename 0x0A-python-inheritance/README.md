#0x0A. Python - Inheritance

# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing concepts related to Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a specific emphasis on Inheritance. The tasks involve creating classes, utilizing inheritance, and implementing various functionalities to achieve the specified learning objectives.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks, each addressing specific aspects of inheritance and OOP. Below is a brief description of each task:

### Task 0: Lookup

Implement a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object without importing any module.

### Task 1: My List

Create a class `MyList` that inherits from the built-in `list` class. Add a method to print the list in sorted order.

### Task 2: Exact Same Object

Write a function to determine if an object is exactly an instance of the specified class.

### Task 3: Same Class or Inherit From

Implement a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or if it inherits from, a specified class.

### Task 4: Only Sub Class Of

Create a function to check if an object is an instance of a class that inherited directly or indirectly from a specified class.

### Task 5: Geometry Module

Define an empty class `BaseGeometry` to be used as a base class for geometry-related classes.

### Task 6: Improve Geometry

Enhance the `BaseGeometry` class by adding a method `area` that raises an exception to indicate it is not implemented.

### Task 7: Integer Validator

Extend `BaseGeometry` with a method to validate integer values, raising appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs.

### Task 8: Rectangle

Create a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and implements instantiation with width and height.

### Task 9: Full Rectangle

Enhance the `Rectangle` class by adding the area method and customizing the print representation.

### Task 10: Square #1

Implement a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and handles instantiation with a size attribute.

### Task 11: Square #2

Modify the `Square` class to customize the print representation.

### Task 12: My Integer (Advanced)

Create a class `MyInt` that inherits from `int` with inverted == and != operators.

### Task 13: Can I? (Advanced)

Write a function to add a new attribute to an object if possible, raising an exception if not.

## Usage

Make sure to follow the provided guidelines for coding style, documentation, and testing. Use the provided test scripts to verify the correctness of your implementations.
